# ModelAdmin temporarily disabled due to compatibility issues with Wagtail 7.x
# We'll use the main Django admin (Unfold) for managing store models instead

# from wagtail_modeladmin.options import ModelAdmin, modeladmin_register
# from wagtail.admin.panels import FieldPanel
# from store.models import Product, Category, Company, Order, Review, Contact

# For now, all store model management is handled through the main Django admin at /admin/
# This provides better functionality and doesn't have compatibility issues
